# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Machine-Learning--project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to assess credit risk by predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making in financial institutions.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer demographics and financial attributes  
- Identified correlations between features and default risk  
- Visualized trends using bar charts, heatmaps, and distributions  

### 3. Model Building
Models implemented:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve  
- Feature Importance Analysis

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Tree-based models performed better in capturing complex risk patterns  
- Key factors such as income, credit history, and loan amount strongly influenced default risk  
- The final model achieved strong recall, reducing false negatives in risk prediction
